The Modelio U2TP module supports software tests modeling. It provides the test designer with dedicated commands and graphics to assist in the specification of test systems.
The Modelio U2TP module is based on the analysis of the UML Testing Profile specification version 1.0 from 05.07.07. It implements the U2TP extension to UML specification and is developed for the Modelio 2.x open source MDE workbench. To use the profile you need at least:
