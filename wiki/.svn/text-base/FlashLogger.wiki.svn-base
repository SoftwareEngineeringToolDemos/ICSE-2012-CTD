The !FlashLogger allows user interactions with a Flash application to
be automatically logged (the programmer does not need to manually insert logging code). Logs can be collected by the client through !JavaScript APIs, or remotely using the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/fittest/wiki/FittestIte">FITTEST
Integrated Testing Environment (ITE)</a>. In principle it is possible to do custom remote retrieval by implementing the same protocol between the logger and the ITE, see the documentation.

The logger produces logs in the FITTEST format. The format is described the [http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2012/2012-014.pdf UU-CS-2012-014] technical report. The format is text-based, well defined and deeply structured (e.g. allowing objects to be serialized into a log), but more compact than e.g. XML.

An example of a FITTEST log fragment:

{{{
%<S "O:Person"
%<P %<{ I =0:ID }%>
%<{ name="Sponge Bob ":String }%>
%<{ age=4:int }%>
%<{ spouse=> }%> 
%>
%<S "O:Person"
  ... // here is the spouse object
%>
%>
}}} 

To facilitate processing by other tools, the format can be converted to XML by using [HaslogSuite Haslog suite].
