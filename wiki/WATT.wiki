WATT and is a crawler that explores a PHP web application collecting information about its structure. Starting from a user provided URL, the crawler follows links and submits forms in the application in a depth-first manner generating traces of the actions performed. While crawling WATT collects information about form structures, discovered links, executed requests, input data used and response codes to executed requests and saves this information to the database.

This tool is also integrated into the ITE.
